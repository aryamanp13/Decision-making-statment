# Aim:
To study and implement C++ decision making statements

## Theory:

## Algorithm:

1.Start

2.Declare variables:
choice: Integer to store the user's choice of operation.
a, b: Integers to store the two input numbers.
x, y, z, q: Integers to store the results of calculations.

3.Display menu:
Print options for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

4.Read user choice:
Input the user's choice and store it in choice.
Input numbers:

5.Prompt the user to enter the first number and store it in a.

6.Prompt the user to enter the second number and store it in b.

7.Perform operation based on choice:

Use a switch statement to handle different choices:
Case 1 (Addition):
Calculate x = a + b
Print the sum x
Case 2 (Subtraction):
Calculate y = a - b
Print the difference y
Case 3 (Multiplication):
Calculate z = a * b
Print the product z
Case 4 (Division):
Check if b is zero:
If b is zero, print a "Divide by zero error" message.
Otherwise, calculate q = a / b and print the quotient q.

8.Default case:
Print an error message for invalid input.

9.End
